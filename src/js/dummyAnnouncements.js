	content: "FYI - from STePS team\n\nPOSTER PRINTING:-  The project group leaders can approach SoC technical " +
	"services with your student card to print one free copy of your poster from 14th Apr. Please go with high " +
	"resolution version (at least 300 dpi) of your poster in PDF format. 12pm-2pm is lunchtime for SoC technical " +
	"services, please avoid this slot.The following dates are assigned for each module. We recommend you to print your " +
	"posters on or before the date assigned for your module.\n\n	CS 3240: 15 Apr\n\nEach poster should carry the " +
	"project ID (top left cornet, big font size), title, sponsors logo (bottom). More details about this is available " +
	"at STePS website - FAQ section. [Use only those logo images provided in the FAQ section. These are HIGH-RESOLUTION " +
	"logos.].\n\nYour project id will be in the form - \"####-##\"available at : " +
	"http://steps.comp.nus.edu.sg/steps6/abstracts.html.\n\n	Poster Guidelines\n\nPosters size is A1 (841 x 594 mm)." +
	"\nIt should consist of approx 25% text, 45% graphics and 30% empty space (do not cram the poster full with " +
	"information).\nThe poster should be printed on one sheet.\n	The poster material should be organised into " +
	"sections presented in a logical sequence which is easy for the viewer to follow (usually top-bottom, left-right," +
	" with the Introduction at top left and Conclusions at bottom right).\nTry to keep text to a minimum; use short " +
	"sentences (or sentence fragments) and paragraphs to convey your message.\n	The text font size should be legible " +
	"from at least 1.5m (18 pt), with larger (at least 32pt) section headings; bold text is easier to read from a " +
	"distance.\n	Don’t use too many different fonts as this can distract the viewer’s attention, as can too many " +
	"bright clashing colours.\n	Graphics (and photos), large enough to be clearly discernible from 1.5m, should be " +
	"used wherever possible. Label graphs directly (no legends, keys) and use colour, rather than patterns, to " +
	"distinguish different data sets and areas of interest. Avoid combining red and green for those viewers who may be " +
	"red/green colour blind. Make sure you use an adequate font size for graphics labels to be legible from 1.5m.",
